## 🔍 Analysis Queries

### 1. Total content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_content FROM netflix;
```

### 2. Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS nbr_of_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

### 3. Most common rating for each type

```sql
SELECT type, rating
FROM (
  SELECT type, rating, COUNT(*),
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
  FROM netflix
  GROUP BY type, rating
) t
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

### 4. Movies released in 2020

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND release_year = 2020;
```

### 5. Top 5 countries with most content

```sql
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS new_country,
       COUNT(*) AS nbr_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY new_country
ORDER BY nbr_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 6. Longest movie

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(STRING_TO_ARRAY(duration,' '))[1]::INT AS duration_in_minutes, *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY duration_in_minutes DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 7. Content added in the last 5 years

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

### 8. Movies/TV Shows by director *Rajiv Chilaka*

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(director, ',')) AS new_director
  FROM netflix
) t
WHERE new_director = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```

### 9. TV Shows with more than 5 seasons

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, (STRING_TO_ARRAY(duration,' '))[1] AS duration_in_season
  FROM netflix
  WHERE type = 'TV Show'
) t
WHERE duration_in_season::INT > 5;
```

### 10. Number of content items per genre

```sql
SELECT UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,
       COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 11. Top 5 years with highest average content release in India

```sql
SELECT country, release_year,
       COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
       ROUND(
         COUNT(show_id)::NUMERIC /
         (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::NUMERIC * 100,
       2) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
